## Completed Work

- Added assignment workflow keyboard shortcuts:
  - `[` selects previous guest
  - `]` selects next guest
  - `U` unassigns currently selected guest
- Added occupancy summary indicators in toolbar:
  - occupied seats / total seats
  - unseated guest count
- Added guest CSV tools in sidebar:
  - import guests from CSV (`name,group,notes`)
  - export current guest list to CSV
- Updated plan save API to sync tables by ID instead of deleting all tables.
- Preserved assignment continuity for unchanged tables during plan saves.
- Removed assignments automatically when:
  - a table is deleted from the plan
  - seat count is reduced below existing assigned seat numbers
- Returned updated plan payload from save and rehydrated client plan state after save.
- Refreshed guests/assignments after save to keep UI and DB state aligned.
- Updated local table ID generation to stable unique IDs for safer persistence/upsert behavior.
- Updated docs for recent UX additions:
  - seat legend overlay
  - separated selected-guest edit section
  - anchored seat picker behavior
- Replaced direct seat-click assignment with anchored seat picker popover.
- Seat picker now shows:
  - seat number
  - current assigned guest (or unassigned)
  - guest list for assignment
  - unassign action
- Updated seat click flow:
  - click seat -> open picker
  - choose guest -> assign (and swap if seat is occupied)
  - unassign seat from picker
- Preserved existing floating table editor anchored to selected table.
- Kept guest panel on the left and preserved full-height canvas layout.
- Anchored floating table editor to selected table position inside the canvas viewport.
- Added interactive seat targets on tables.
- Added click-to-assign flow:
  - select guest, then click an empty seat to assign.
- Added unassign flow:
  - click selected guest's current seat to unassign.
  - with no selected guest, click an occupied seat to unassign occupant.
- Added swap flow:
  - select guest, then click a seat occupied by another guest to swap positions.
- Added visual seat occupancy states:
  - empty seats
  - occupied seats
  - selected guest's seat highlighted.
- Added conflict seat state styling (red highlight) on assignment failures.
- Added inline seat-picker error feedback for assignment/unassignment failures.
- Added inline success/info feedback badges for assignment outcomes:
  - assigned
  - swapped
  - already assigned
  - already unassigned
- Wired assignment UX to existing API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/seating-plans/:planId/assignments`
  - `DELETE /api/seating-plans/:planId/assignments/:assignmentId`

## Commands Run

- `corepack pnpm lint` (pass)
- `corepack pnpm typecheck` (pass)

## Check Results

- Lint: pass.
- TypeScript: pass.
- Build: pass.

## How To Test

1. Run `corepack pnpm dev`.
2. Open a plan editor (`/seating-plans/{id}`).
3. Add at least two guests and assign them to seats.
4. Use keyboard:
  - `]` to select next guest
  - `[` to select previous guest
  - `U` to unassign selected guest
5. Verify toolbar shows occupancy (`occupied/total`) and unseated guest count.
6. Export guests to CSV and import the CSV back.
7. Save and refresh; verify assignments still persist.

## Known Issues

- Drag guest-to-seat interaction is not implemented yet (click/picker flow is primary).

## Next Recommended Step

Post-MVP optional enhancements:

- Drag guest-to-seat assignment flow.
- Better CSV validation (quoted commas/newlines).
- Bulk assignment management and advanced filters.
